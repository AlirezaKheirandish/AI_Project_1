# Processing-EEG-Signals

EEG signals have a lot of applications in biomedical engineering. In this project which was the final course project on computational intelligence, we had some information about the group of persons and we wanted to detect if they move their right hand or their left hand. We use computational intelligence algorithms to do the project.

At the first, we extracted features from EEG signals, and then by applying a simple one-layer neural network we reach the result of 87% in training with 5-fold training and we reach the result of 75% on the test data.

And another network we trained was the RBF network and we reach 75% accuracy on the test data either.
